### Basics of ML
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. At its core, ML aims to allow computers to improve their performance on a specific task over time without being explicitly programmed for it.

### Types of ML
1. **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each example is paired with a corresponding target label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs based on the provided dataset.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, where the system tries to find patterns or intrinsic structures within the data without explicit guidance.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing it to learn the optimal behavior through trial and error.

### Terminologies
- **Feature**: A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed.
- **Model**: A model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process or system that is trained on data to make predictions or decisions.
- **Training**: Training is the process of feeding data into a machine learning algorithm to enable it to learn patterns or relationships within the data.
- **Testing**: Testing involves evaluating the performance of a trained model on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.
- **Accuracy**: Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances by a model among the total instances evaluated.
- **Overfitting**: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or irrelevant patterns that hinder its performance on new data.
- **Underfitting**: Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, leading to poor performance on both training and unseen data.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in ML where raw data is transformed and cleaned to prepare it for analysis and model training. This process may involve:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting errors, missing values, or inconsistencies in the data.
- **Data Transformation**: Standardizing or normalizing features, encoding categorical variables, or scaling numerical values to ensure compatibility with the ML algorithms.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of the ML model.

### Data Analysis
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making. It typically involves:
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizing and visualizing data to understand its basic characteristics, such as central tendency, dispersion, and distribution.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring data to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies using statistical and visualization techniques.
- **Inferential Analysis**: Making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data using statistical methods.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Building models to predict future outcomes or trends based on historical data, such as regression or classification models.
