<br>

SwiftML is designed for easy machine learning (ML) model development without the need for coding. Follow these steps to use SwiftML:

---

### **Getting Started**:
1. Hover to the `Process Data` section.
2. Upload your dataset.
3. Choose your target variable.
4. Choose the type of your problem.
5. Click "Submit" to start the process.

---

### **Model Training**: 
SwiftML will take care of selecting the best algorithm and hyperparameters for your dataset. This process may take some time depending on the size of your dataset and complexity of the model.

---

### **Model Evaluation**: 
Once the model is trained, SwiftML will provide evaluation metrics to assess its performance. You can use these metrics to determine the effectiveness of your model.

---

### **Deployment**: 
After training and evaluation, your model will be deployed using either Streamlit or Render CLI, allowing you to share your model with others and use it in real-world applications.
