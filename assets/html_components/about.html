<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Welcome to Swiftml !
        With backgrounds in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence, we've   
        bundled several frameworks to come up with an application which is capable of automating 
        end-to-end model deployment. The application will analyse user-provide datasets and select 
        the most suitable algorithm for prediction. The package will handle preprocessing, feature 
        selection, algorithm selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment and also aims to 
        streamline the machine learning process for users with varying levels of expertise. </p>  
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Our mission is to develop a high-level abstraction tool capable of analysing user-provided 
        datasets to identify the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for prediction. We   
        believe that democratizing access to AI technologies is crucial for driving innovation and 
        solving complex challenges across various domains.
        Through our platform, we strive to break down barriers and provide users with the tools and 
        resources they need to succeed in their machine learning endeavours.
</p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>We envision a future where machine learning is seamlessly integrated into everyday 
        workflows, enabling individuals and organizations to make data-driven decisions with 
        confidence. By fostering a community of learners and practitioners, we aim to foster 
        collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning in the field of AI.
